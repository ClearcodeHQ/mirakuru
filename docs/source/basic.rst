Basic executors
===============

Mirakuru :class:`~mirakuru.base.Executor` is something that you will use when you
need to make some code dependant from other process being run, and in certain state,
and you wouldn't want this process to be running all the time.

Tests would be best example here or a script that sets up processes and databases
for dev environment with one simple run.


SimpleExecutor
--------------

:class:`mirakuru.base.SimpleExecutor` is the simplest executor implementation.
It simply starts the process passed to constructor, and reports it as running.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import SimpleExecutor

    process = SimpleExecutor('my_special_process')
    process.start()

    # Here you can do your stuff, e.g. communicate with the started process

    process.stop()

OutputExecutor
--------------

:class:`mirakuru.output.OutputExecutor` is the executor that starts the process,
but does not report it as started, unless it receives specified marker/banner in
process output.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import OutputExecutor

    process = OutputExecutor('my_special_process', banner='processed!')
    process.start()

    # Here you can do your stuff, e.g. communicate with the started process

    process.stop()

What happens during start here, is that the executor constantly checks output
produced by started process, and looks for the banner part occurring within the
output.
Once the output is identified, as in example `processed!` is found in output.
It is considered as started, and executor releases your script from wait to work.


TCPExecutor
-----------

:class:`mirakuru.tcp.TCPExecutor` is the executor that should be used to start
processes that are using TCP connection. This executor tries to connect with
the process on given host:port to see if it started accepting connections. Once it
does, it reports the process as started and a code returns to normal execution.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import TCPExecutor

    process = TCPExecutor('my_special_process', host='localhost', port=1234)
    process.start()

    # Here you can do your stuff, e.g. communicate with the started process

    process.stop()


HTTPExecutor
------------

:class:`mirakuru.http.HTTPExecutor` is executor that will be used to start
web applications for example. To start it, you apart from command, you need to pass a URL.
This URL will be used to make a (by default) HEAD request. Once successful,
the executor will be considered started, and a code will return to normal execution.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import HTTPExecutor

    process = HTTPExecutor('my_special_process', url='http://localhost:6543/status')
    process.start()

    # Here you can do your stuff, e.g. communicate with the started process

    process.stop()

This executor, however, apart from HEAD request, also inherits TCPExecutor,
so it'll try to connect to process over TCP first, to determine,
if it can try to make a HEAD request already.

By default HTTPExecutor waits until its subprocess responds with 2XX HTTP status code.
If you consider other codes as valid you need to specify them in 'status' argument.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import HTTPExecutor

    process = HTTPExecutor('my_special_process', url='http://localhost:6543/status', status='(200|404)')
    process.start()

The "status" argument can be a single code integer like 200, 404, 500 or a regular expression string -
'^(2|4)00$', '2\d\d', '\d{3}', etc.

There's also a possibility to change the request method used to perform request to the server.
By default it's HEAD, but GET, POST or other are also possible.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import HTTPExecutor

    process = HTTPExecutor('my_special_process', url='http://localhost:6543/status', status='(200|404)', method='GET')
    process.start()


PidExecutor
-----------

:class:`mirakuru.pid.PidExecutor` is an executor that starts the given
process, and then waits for a given file to be found before it gives back control.
An example use for this class is writing integration tests for processes that
notify their running by creating a .pid file.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import PidExecutor

    process = PidExecutor('my_special_process', filename='/var/msp/my_special_process.pid')
    process.start()

    # Here you can do your stuff, e.g. communicate with the started process

    process.stop()


As a Context manager
--------------------

Starting
++++++++

Mirakuru executors can also work as a context managers.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import HTTPExecutor

    with HTTPExecutor('my_special_process', url='http://localhost:6543/status') as process:

        # Here you can do your stuff, e.g. communicate with the started process
        assert process.running() is True

    assert process.running() is False

Defined process starts upon entering context, and exit upon exiting it.

Stopping
++++++++

Mirakuru also allows to stop process for given context.
To do this, simply use built-in stopped context manager.

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import HTTPExecutor

    process = HTTPExecutor('my_special_process', url='http://localhost:6543/status').start()

    # Here you can do your stuff, e.g. communicate with the started process

    with process.stopped():

        # Here you will not be able to communicate with the process as it is killed here
        assert process.running() is False
        
    assert process.running() is True

Defined process stops upon entering context, and starts upon exiting it.


Methods chaining
----------------

Mirakuru encourages methods chaining so you can inline some operations, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    from mirakuru import SimpleExecutor

    command_stdout = SimpleExecutor('my_special_process').start().stop().output
