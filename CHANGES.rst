2.4.2
=====

Misc
----

+ Added Python 3.10 to classifiers

2.4.1
=====

Misc
----

- Use strictier mypy checks

2.4.0
=====

Features
--------

- Replace `exp_sig` executor parameter with `expected_returncode`.
  Parameter description already assumed that, however handing it assumed full
  POSIX compatibility on the process side. Now the POSIX is only assumed if no
  `expected_returncode` is passed to the executor, and returncode is simply that,
  a returncode, nothing more

2.3.1
=====

Misc
----

- Moved CI to Github Actions
- Blackified codebase
- Compacted Documentation into readme (was pretty small anyway)

2.3.0
=====

- [enhancement] Ability to set up expected exit code for executor. In Java exit codes 1- 127 have 
  special meaning, and the regular exit codes are offset by those of special meaning.

2.2.0
=====

- [enhancement] If process is being closed and the shutdown won't be clean (won't return exit code 0)
  mirakuru will now rise ProcessFinishedWithError exception with exit_code

=====

- [feature] Drop support for python 3.5. Rely on typing syntax and fstrings that
  is available since python 3.6 only
- [ehnancement] For output executor on MacOs fallback to `select.select` for OutputExecutor.
  Increases compatibility with MacOS where presence of `select.poll` depends
  on the compiler used.
- [enhancement] Apply shelx.quote on command parts if command is given as a list
  Should result in similar results when running such command with or without shell.

=====

- [feature] Add UnixSocketExecutor for executors that communicate with Unix Sockets

- [feature] Drop support for python 2

1.1.0
=====

- [enhancement] Executor's timeout to be set for both executor's start and stop
- [enhancement] It's no longer possible to hang indefinitely on the start
  or stop. Timeout is set to 3600 seconds by default, with values possible
  between `0` and `sys.maxsize` with the latter still bit longer
  than `2924712086` centuries.

1.0.0

- [enhancement] when killing the process ignore OsError with errno `no such process` as the process have already died.
- [enhancement] small context manager code cleanup


0.8.2
